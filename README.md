# Quadratic equation solver
First project in Huawei school.

# About 
This programm solves quadratic equations in real numbers.

## Example
### Solving the equation
Square equation solver
(c) Krot, 2021
Enter a, b, c: 10 23 2
x1 = -2.20948, x2 = -0.090519

### Unit tests
We ask the user whether to test the program.

>Do you want to Test your program? (Y)(Other symbol)

If you enter 'Y'. All functions will be tested. These tests help to understand that all functions work correctly.
